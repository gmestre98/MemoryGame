# MemoryGame
A Systems Programming project with the implentation of the memory game using multiplayer and playing simultaneously

In this project we were asked to develop in C a memory game in which there were no turns so all players could play simultaneously. To this we implemented a Server and a Client application, having the server managing all the access on the board and sending updated boards to the clients which displayed it in the graphical interface.

For test purposes it was also developed a bot application pretty similar to the client one, just differing that it plays alone!
